Zettelkasten else known as Second Brain were thought to be, one of the best way to built your own thought. Luhmann’s Zettelkasten is a collection of notes on paper slips with a special twist: It is a _hypertext_ that he could navigate the drawer cabinet containing all the paper slips with a _reasonable_ amount of time and energy.

"A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection."
